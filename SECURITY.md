# Security Policy

Security is a priority for us. This document outlines our security policy and how to responsibly report security vulnerabilities found in this repository.

## Supported Versions

Currently, the project is in the alpha phase of development. 

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| < 1.0.0 | :x: (Alpha / Dev)  |

Once the project reaches a stable release, this table will be updated.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We heavily rely on static site generation (SSG), which significantly reduces the attack surface. However, if you discover a valid security vulnerability in our code or its dependencies, please let us know.

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
2. Kindly send an e-mail to **anna.zezulka@proton.me** with details about the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and potential impact.
3. We will acknowledge your report and strive to fix the issue as quickly as possible.

*Note: This is a non-profit project. We do not offer a paid Bug Bounty program, but we will gladly give you credit in our repository for any valid, impactful security reports.*
